### The most important part of a cluster analysis is to interpret the resulting clusters. As a final step, we'll use the parallel coordinate plot and cluster means table to interpret the Bustabit gambling user groups! Roughly speaking, we can breakdown the groups as follows:

<p><strong><p style="color:#d95f02">Cautious Commoners:</p></strong> This is the largest of the five clusters, and might be described as the more casual Bustabit players. They've played the fewest number of games overall, and tend to make more conservative bets in general. </p>

<p><strong><p style="color:#66a61e">Strategic Addicts:</p></strong> These users play a lot of games on Bustabit, but tend to keep their bets under control. As a result, they've made on average a net positive earnings from the site, in spite of having the most games played. They seem to maintain a strategy (or an automated script/bot) that works to earn them money.</p>

<p><strong><p style="color:#7570b3">Risky Commoners:</p></strong> These users seem to be a step above the Cautious Commoners in their Bustabit gambling habits, making larger average bets, and playing a larger number of games on the site. As a result, though they have about the same number of average games won as the Risk Takers, they have a significantly higher number of games lost.</p>

<p><strong><p style="color:#1b9e77">Risk Takers: </p></strong> These users have played only a couple games on average, but their average cashed out value is significantly higher than the other clusters, indicating that they tend to wait for the multiplier to increase to large values before cashing out.</p>

<p><strong><p style="color:#e7298a">High Rollers:</p></strong> High bets are the name of the game for this group. They bet large sums of money in each game, although they tend to cash out at lower multipliers and thus play the game more conservatively, particularly compared to the Risk Takers. Interestingly, these users have also on average earned a net positive earnings from their games played.</p>
