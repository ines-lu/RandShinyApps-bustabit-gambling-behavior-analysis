#### The primary task at hand is to cluster Bustabit <strong>players</strong> by their respective gambling habits. To better quantify player behavior, let's group the data by player (<code>Username</code>) to begin thinking about the relationship and similarity between groups of players. Some per-player features created are:

<ol>

<li><strong>AverageCashedOut</strong> - The average multiplier at which the player cashes out</li>

<li><strong>AverageBet</strong> - The average bet made by the player</li>

<li><strong>TotalProfit</strong> - The total profits over time for the player</li>

<li><strong>TotalLosses</strong> - The total losses over time for the player</li>

<li><strong>GamesWon</strong> - The total number of individual games the player won</li>

<li><strong>GamesLost</strong> - The total number of individual games the player lost</li>

</ol>
