#### The similarities and differences in the behaviors of different people have long been of interest, particularly in psychology and other social science fields. Understanding human behavior in particular contexts can help us to make informed decisions. 


<p>Along these lines, I am going to focus on the behavior on <strong>online gamblers</strong> from a platform called <a href="https://www.bustabit.com" target="_blank">Bustabit</a>. 

The goal of this analysis is to define relevant <strong>groups</strong> or <strong>clusters</strong> of Bustabit users to identify what patterns and behaviors of gambling persist. Can we describe a particular group as risk-averse? Is there a set of gamblers that have a strategy that seems to be more successful in the long term?</p>

#### There are a few basic rules for playing a game of Bustabit:
<ol>

<li>You bet a certain amount of money (in Bits, which is 1 / 1,000,000th of a Bitcoin) and you win if you cash out before the game <strong>busts</strong>.</li>

<li>Your win is calculated by the multiplier value at the moment you cashed out. For example, if you bet 100 and the value was 2.50x at the time you cashed out, you win 250. In addition, a percentage <code>Bonus</code> per game is multiplied with your bet and summed to give your final <code>Profit</code> in a winning game. Assuming a <code>Bonus</code> of 1%, your <code>Profit</code> for this round would be <code>(100 x 2.5) + (100 x .01) - 100 = 151</code></li>

<li>The multiplier increases as time goes on, but if you wait too long to cash out, you may bust and lose your money.</li>

<li>Lastly, the house maintains slight advantages because in 1 out of every 100 games, everyone playing busts.</li>

</ol>

<p>Below we see an example of a winning game:</p>
