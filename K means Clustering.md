### K means clustering
<p>With standardized data of per-player features, I chose the mostly used method, K means clustering, in order to cluster the players based on their online gambling behavior. </p>
<p>- Without prior knowledge, it is often difficult to know what an appropriate choice for the number of clusters is. I began by choosing <strong>five clusters</strong>, which is between too many clusters (which reduces the interpretability of the final results), and too few clusters (which may not capture the distinctive behaviors effectively). </p>
<p>- Because the K means algorithm uses a random start, I chose <strong>20211101</strong> as the random seed to ensure the results are reproducible.</p>
